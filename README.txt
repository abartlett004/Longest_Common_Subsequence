This project uses Python (version 3.6.12) as well as the NumPy library (version 1.19.1)
and the argparse, re, and time libraries that come standard with Python. It was 
developed using the Sublime Text 3 text editor and run on a Ubuntu system through 
the use of Windows Subsystem for Linux 2. 

To run this code:

1) Ensure that Python and the required libraries are installed

2) Ensure that the Lab3_driver.py file is located in the same directory as 
the Lab3_LCS.py and Lab3_utils.py files

3) Open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing the Lab3_driver.py,
and enter the command "python Lab3_driver.py" followed by an argument containing
the path to your input file as well as a path to your desired output file, 
if desired. If your input file is valid, your output will be written to "output.txt"
or the path specified in the command. If not, you will receive an error describing 
the issue with the input file
